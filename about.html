<h4>About Me:</h4>

<div>
  Hi, my name is Troy, but my friends call me Ronin. I'm a degree candidate at the 
  Harvard Extension School, with a focus in computer science. My background is in clinical 
  social work, and I decided to pursue my interest in science and technology 
  after becoming inspired by the potential of digital health and therapeutics. I'm excited about
  the innovative ways technology can be utilized to address healthcare needs. I'm taking PHYS S-12
  to gain first-hand experience with the process of developing both hardware and software.
