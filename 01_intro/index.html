<h1>Week 1: Introduction</h1>

<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>

<br>
<div>
  <p>I originally wanted to create a neurofeedback device using an EEG sensor to detect brain wave 
  patterns, and then feed these into a visual display using something like unity 3D that could 
  give a user real time feedback on their brainwave patterns. This would give the user the 
  ability to entrain their brain waves toward a more optimal state, which could be used to
  reduce stress, increase relaxation, or develop concentration. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After consulting with teaching staff and searching for possible ways to implement this 
    project, we came to the conclusion that independently creating an EEG scanner would 
    present a challenge beyond the scope of the course, and that purchasing the components
    would be financially inadvisable. I therefore decided to change my project to one 
    more reasonably implementable. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I still wanted my project to focus on the use of biometric data, so I conducted further
    research on biosensors that would be less challenging to create. I landed on the idea of 
    using an ECG/EKG reader that could detect the heart rate of the user, using the AD8232 chip. 
    These signals would be easier to process and less prone to interference. I then want to 
    wirelessly send these signals to an external audio/visual device that would create a real 
    time digital representation of the user's heartbeat, in the form of lights, colors, or sounds. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of this device would be to enhance the user's interoception, which is defined as
    the ability to sense the internal physiological state of the body and its organs. Studies have
    shown that underdeveloped or inaccurate interoceptive sensing is negatively correlated with 
    psychological wellbeing, and that intentionally improving this skill can improve health outcomes.
    By amplifying the user's biosignals, they can develop greater awareness of their physiological
    and emotional states, leading to increased ability for self-regulation.
