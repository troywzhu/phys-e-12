<h1>Week 7: Output Devices</h1>

<h2>Ultrasonic LED Servo</h2>

<br>

<div>
  <p>
    This week I began experimenting with using both LED strips and a servo motor as my output device.
    For this purpose I utilized Adafruit's NeoPixel Library and a great introductory guide that can
    be found <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-use">here</a>.
    I initially began my experiment with my input devices being an infrared sensor combined with a TV remote 
    control. I combined these so that every time I pressed a button on the remote control, when this signal
    was detected it would prompt the LED to begin lighting. I also experimented with using an infrared LED 
    transmitter so that I could modulate the strength of the signal. I then programmed it to alter the lighting
    color depending on the strength of the signal.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the next iteration of my input-output device, I attached the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor to be my
    input tranmission, and I combined a servo motor with the LED strip to be a dual output device. This aligns with
    the goals of my final project where I will be combining proximity motion detection that simultaneously activates
    both lighting and mechanical motion for a series of lanterns. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I used two different mapping functions to translate data from the proximity sensor into degrees of motion and 
    hues of color for the servo motor and LED strip respectively. Attention was given to prevent the servo motor 
    from attempting to continue moving past its maximum range of motion to prevent burning out its engine. Mapping 
    the distances from the sensor into a spectrum color hues proved a challenging task that took a while to decipher.
    Because of the multiple ways that NeoPixel stores color values in differing formats, from HSV data, to packed RGB codes.
    Then, having to apply a gamma correction filter to make the colors perceptually accurate to the human eye, created
    an extra layer of difficulty. It took a while to figure this out, as I also needed to make sure the coding for the HSV
    colors ranged from red to blue, instead of looping back towards red once the colors reached the ultraviolet spectrum.
  </p>

  <p>
    Engineering the circuit this way enabled me to create a much greater range of analog feedback through my output devices,
    rather than having a narrow or minimal responsiveness. Creating a nearly instantaneous integration between the input and output 
    creates a more seamless user experience. I aim to continue refining this, so that it will enhance the overall aesthetic experience 
    of the final product.
    </p>

        This is a <a href="./code.html">link</a> to the code for this assignment, where we also utilized principles of Object Oriented Programming to create
        classes for the multiple components of our device, which allows us to avoid using the delay() function that delays the 
        processing speed of the entire microcontroller.
