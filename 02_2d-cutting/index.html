<h1>Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting</h1>

<br>
<div>
    <p>This week we began learning how to use the laser-cutter, vinyl cutter, 2-D and basic 3-D modeling with CAD software Fusion 360, and measuring items with calipers.</p>

    <p>We were taught about Kerf, which is an important concept in laser cutting. Because the laser eats away part of our materials, we need to modify our design to account for this, since our final product's measurements will be slightly off from our initial design measurements by roughly 1mm.</p>
    
    <p>We are designing push-fit components, which are similar to puzzle pieces which have reciprocal edges and notches that lock together. This process teaches us how simple 2-D components can be combined to create complex 3-D objects. This process opened my eyes to how versatile a material cardboard can be, and especially how it presents an incredibly low-cost material for rapid prototyping, which is perfect for our purposes. </p>
    
    <p>I was fascinated by the design of ‘living hinges’ that give us the ability to create flexible, movable objects out of completely rigid materials. I decided to experiment modeling living hinges in Fusion 360. Having never used the F360 software before, I followed some of the excellent tutorials produced by the youtube community, as well as official documentation from the company itself.     <img src="../pics/hinge.png" width="150" height="121">

    <p>For my final project I thought it would make the most sense to include a spherical object that could house my lighting output device. The closest comparable designs I found for this were essentially different types of lamps and lanterns. Using Fusion 360 I designed a push-fit construction using two primary components that could be used to create a spherical shell.

    <p>It was exciting to make my very first test run on the laser cutter. An unexpected result was that minor burning occurred during the cutting process, and after consulting with lab technicians, the issue appears related to the thinness of the cardboard material and the pockets of air between its layers contributing to combustion. Although the material was around 4mm, because much of medium was an empty air pocket, adjusting the laser-cutter settings to a material width of 1mm corrected for this error.

    </p>

    <p> I consolidated the objects into a single file to create an economical usage of space. After drafting and cutting with 1mm material-width settings, the resulting shapes came out perfectly.

    </p>

    <p>The only issue was the press-kit construction kit's notches did not fit together tightly enough, so I readjusted the notch spacing from 2mm to 4mm to create a more secure fitting.

    <p>After the initial test prints were conducted and adjustments were made, I prepared the final version and documented their final construction.

    <pr> I then experimented with using the vinyl cutter to make geometric shaped stickers. <br>
